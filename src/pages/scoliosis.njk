        <h1>Scoliosis: 6‑month scholarship (1 spot)</h1>
        <p>
          I’m looking for <strong>one committed person with scoliosis</strong> who can train consistently for 24 weeks and track progress. You must be available on weekdays <strong>6:30–8:30am</strong> or <strong>6–10pm</strong> and be willing to place a <strong>$1,000 commitment bond</strong> (refunded or credited if you complete the program).

    <h2>Why Functional Patterns for scoliosis?</h2>
    <p>
      Scoliosis isn’t just “a curve.” It often shows up alongside compensation patterns: shifted ribs/pelvis,
      uneven loading through feet/hips, asymmetrical breathing mechanics, and movement strategies that keep reinforcing
      the same bias day after day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Functional Patterns lens is simple: <strong>your structure reflects your repeated inputs</strong>.
      Training is about upgrading those inputs—how you stand, walk, breathe, hinge, rotate, and load—so your body has
      a reason to organize differently over time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="benefits">
    <h2>Potential benefits you may notice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced pain, stiffness, and “hot spots” from chronic compensation</li>
      <li>Better breathing mechanics and trunk control under load</li>
      <li>Improved balance and left/right symmetry in walking and training</li>
      <li>More confidence in daily movement and sport</li>
      <li>A clearer plan (instead of random exercises that don’t move the needle)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="microcopy">
      Some people may also see measurable changes in curvature over time. Others may primarily see improvements
      in pain, function, and control. Either way, we track objectively.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>The offer</h2>
    <p>
      I want to run this as a structured, high‑accountability case study. The goal is to create a clear “before/after”
      story based on objective measures and training consistency.
